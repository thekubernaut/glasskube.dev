Software developers nowadays have a lot of options when choosing a container registry to upload containers to their infrastructure or share the artifacts with customers.

<!-- truncate -->

But not all OCI registries serve the same purpose.
Some are designed primarily for **internal use**—filling the gap between developers, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment within a single organization.
Others are built for **external distribution**—helping software vendors distribute artifacts to customers,
often across security boundaries or into air-gapped environments.

In this post, we'll compare different registry options, focusing on how each supports real-world software distribution needs.

But first, let's define a few key terms.

## Terminology

- **Registry**: A service for storing and distributing container artifacts.
  Examples include private Docker image registries, OCI registries, and many proprietary registries which will be covered below.
- **Artifact**: Can have multiple meanings, but in this context it refers to an OCI-compliant image.
- **Container Image**: A type of artifact. It consists of manifests and blobs.
- **Digest**: A unique identifier for a specific version of an artifact, typically a SHA256 hash. The digest cannot change.
- **Tag**: A human-readable label for a specific version of an artifact, often used for versioning (e.g., `latest`, `v1.0`, etc.).
  It points to a unique digest.
  If tags in a registry are immutable, it is not possible to change the pointer to another digest.
- **Manifest**: Metadata that defines how blobs are combined to form a container image.
  It can also reference other manifests in the case of a multi-arch image.
- **Blob**: The actual data of an artifact, most commonly an archive of files.
- **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)**: A list of components and dependencies used in a software build. It is most common to directly add it as a layer to the OCI image.
- **Image Signing**: A cryptographic process that ensures the integrity and authenticity of container images. The signature can also be directly integrated into the OCI image.
- **OCI Compliance**: Adherence to the Open Container Initiative standards, ensuring OCI-compliant containers can be used across different platforms.

## What Is a Container Registry?

A container registry is used by software developers as a service to store, manage, and distribute container images and related OCI-compliant artifacts.
It provides APIs for pushing and pulling artifacts and is mostly consumed by CLI clients in CI/CD environments or deployment targets.
Mature container registries come with advanced access control, analytics, and user interfaces.

## Understanding the OCI Format

Based on the original Docker runtime and image format, the Open Container Initiative (OCI) stepped in to standardize these into open, vendor-neutral specifications: the OCI Image, Distribution, and Runtime specs.
This brought consistency and portability to container images, and now, the same is happening for other types of software artifacts.

Popular tools like Helm, Docker, and [ORAS](https://oras.land/) support pushing and pulling OCI-compliant artifacts.
A growing trend is using ORAS to package and store non-OCI-native formats, like Kubeflow pipelines, configuration bundles, or machine learning models, as OCI artifacts.

[ORAS](https://oras.land/) handles the heavy lifting under the hood: it wraps arbitrary files in a compliant OCI format, generating the appropriate manifests, content digests, and metadata needed to make the artifact registry-friendly.

For example, you can push a machine learning model like this:

```bash
oras push registry.distr.sh/my-org/ml-model:0.0.1 ./model.pkl:application/vnd.myorg.model
```

This command will wrap my `model.pkl` file in an OCI-compliant format of my custom type `application/vnd.myorg.model`, generating the necessary manifest and digest, and then push it to the specified registry.

## Key Considerations When Choosing a Registry

When evaluating registries, consider these core criteria:

**Internal vs. External Use**
Is this for your internal development team's workflow, or for distributing to customers?
This is the most fundamental distinction.

**OCI Compliance Level**
How completely does the registry implement the OCI specification?
This affects which artifact types you can store and distribute.

**Security & Access Controls**
For internal use, integration with your existing IAM may be sufficient.
For external distribution, you'll need granular controls over which artifacts are visible to which customers.
Vulnerability scanning is also an important consideration.

**Deployment Flexibility**
Can the registry be deployed where you need it—cloud, on-prem, or air-gapped environments?

**Support**
Does the registry have a strong support community or a commercial vendor backing?

## List of private (internal) container registries

Internal registries are for the most part built for trusted, in-house use.
They integrate tightly with cloud services, IAM systems, and CI/CD pipelines to support internal teams.

They're ideal when dev and deploy happen inside the same security boundary, with no need to serve external customers.

But they often come with limited user interfaces, access control options, and analytics.

## List of container registries that support external users

External registries face a fundamentally different challenge: distributing software to end customers, usually outside of your organization. That shift requires a different focus: access control, auditing, version visibility, and compliance.

While GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub are excellent for open-source and low-security use cases, they're not well suited for commercial software distribution because they lack:

- **Granular access control**: No way to give specific customers access to specific artifact versions
- **Air-gapped support**: Limited options for distributing to high-security environments
- **Usage visibility**: Missing audit logs and download tracking that commercial vendors need
- **License management**: No built-in capabilities to manage software entitlements

This is where purpose-built external registries like Distr come in, addressing these gaps for vendor-to-customer distribution.

### Distr

![Distr OCI registry](/img/blog/2025-04-07-registry-comparison/distr-cr.png)

[Distr](https://distr.sh/) comes with an OCI-compliant [artifact registry](https://distr.sh/docs/product/registry/) natively built into the platform.
